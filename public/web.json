    "longDescription": "Khaeltheron was designed as a story-driven web experience set in a dark fantasy atmosphere. The goal was to create a digital showcase for an expanding universe, acting more as a digital grimoire than a standard website. I architected the concept, narrative structure, visual flow, and end-to-end user experience, focusing on immersive lore and atmospheric UI. It serves as a technical study on how digital interfaces can evoke specific narrative moods.",
