    "longDescription": "CardCheassy is an experimental project merging classic chess logic with modern card-game mechanics. Players use cards to execute moves, position units, and ultimately aim to destroy the opponent's King piece. It challenges players to think positionally while managing the flexibility of a card-driven hand, creating unique tactical scenarios in every match. The core loop focuses on decision-making, area control, and risk-reward balance.",
